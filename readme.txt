Mat-O-Wahl (*) - A simple to handle, free "Voting-Machine" / "Electoral Compass" clone for everybody 

USE / INSTALLATION
******************

You can find further examples in the folder EXTRAS.
Simply unpack its contents to the DATA folder
(and delete the other content from the DATA folder before, of course).

You can freely change all filenames in the DATA folder to your needs except the DEFINITION.JS.
Your file for the questions could be QUESTIONS.CSV or BLUB.CSV instead of FRAGEN.CSV.
Only take care, that you enter the right name in the DEFINITION.JS.

In addition, the order of lists have to correspond.
You can not write "A-Party.csv, B-Party.csv" for the files
and change it to "B-Party, A-Party" in the names list.

To check your settings, you can start the QUICKTEST.HTML.
It shows you all data from the configuration file (DEFINITION.JS)
and points out possible errors.

You can find further information on-line at http://www.mat-o-wahl.de
or in the help under /SYSTEM
